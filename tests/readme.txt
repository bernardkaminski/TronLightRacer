                                            Unit tests

gameplay: All in GameplayTest.py and PlayerTest.py
player management: All in LoginTest.py and AddUserTest.py (for AddUserTest.py, if it is ran twice, the first test will not pass the second time since the user has already been created during the first time)
statistics: All in StatsTest.py
reading and writing date to file: If LoginTest.py, AddUserTest.py and StatsTest.py pass, it shows that we can successfully read and write data to file, since all of these systems require these functions
integration testing: Check the Integration Testing Document (done manually)
